## 🎬 How it Works

  - Lists 5 adorable things the creator needs (like voice note, photo, your love, etc.)
  - A "Yes" button goes to the next slide.
  - A "No" button tries to run away, but after 2.5 seconds turns into a "Yes" 😍

  - Displays a cute ASCII art and the message:
    > *"I love you to the moon and to Saturn"* 🌙💫
  - Styled in soft Taylor Swift-inspired Folklore theme.

- **Final Slide**:
  - Beautiful font & symbols:
    > ˖ ᡣ𐭩 ⊹ ࣪  ౨ৎ˚₊ I love you 𐙚🧸ྀི
  - And the message:
    > *"Suddenly all Taylor Swift's love songs belong to you... just like you belong to me."* 💘
